# Tic Tac Toe (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

## Introduction
This project is a browser-based **Tic Tac Toe** game built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal was to strengthen my fundamentals in front-end development by building a complete interactive app from scratch — including UI layout, event handling, state management, win/draw logic, and game reset functionality.

Beyond the final game, this project helped me practice writing clean, readable code, debugging DOM interactions, and translating game rules into reliable program logic.

## Key Features
- **Two-player gameplay (X vs O)** on a 3×3 grid
- **Turn tracking** with a live status message (“It’s X’s turn”)
- **Win detection** (rows, columns, diagonals)
- **Draw detection** when the board fills without a winner
- **Restart button** to reset the board and state instantly
- **Simple responsive layout** using CSS Grid

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: page structure and game board cells using `data-cell-index`
- **CSS**: styling + layout with CSS Grid and hover effects
- **JavaScript**: game logic (state, turns, validation, and DOM updates)
